# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out reflection on the assignment.

## Question 1
### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists.

I believe that this research could be used to compose a yearbook-like database of a given year's class. Seeing as each student is required to submit a photo and a superpower, a mock yearbook could easily be composed in a similar fashion to the trading cards. I believe the yearbook format would be more conducive to storing and cataloguing the information from year to year, as you could potentially present the list of students in a cleaner format (but would definitely lose some of the fun of the assignment). In the short-term, I don't think this would make much of a difference but, as you begin dealing with more points of data, I think simply cataloguing from year to year with a yearbook-like format would lead to a cleaner way of sorting through to find a specific student or identify particular trends among students.

## Question 2
### This assignment asks you all to perform a certian amount of work (describing yourselves) in order to improve a project (the course roster website). What responsibilities does the "researcher" (in this case, your teacher) have to the participants (you)? What rights do or should the participants have to the end product? 

I believe that, because this assignment is mandatory, the researcher owes it to the participant to inform them how their data is going to be used. The participant should also have some say in how their data is presented insofar as it is being posted on a public forum. In this case I, the participant, have been given the option to hide my name, email, and github account information if I chose. This amount of agency is sufficient. I believe if this research was not coming from a mandatory assignment, I would not be entitled to this choice (as I am assuming I would be volunteering for this research) but given that it is, I think I should be entitled to the choice of my information being published publicly.

## Question 3
### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?

Seeing as I suggested a similar use for the information, I don't believe I would have any additional limitations imposed on my structure. I do think that, depending on what end I am trying to achieve (for example finding a correlation between X and Y from year to year) I could potentially add more fields to have a larger amount of data to work with. I think the biggest limitation this structure imposes is one of relevancy. I think I would be creating my project with a specific goal in mind, say the correlation between students wanting their information to be public/private and final grade (or something to that effect), and the only limitation would be self-imposed based on the number of fields I ask students to fill out in the JSON file.
